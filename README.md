# Assistly - Multi-Community Assistance Platform

A private, community-based platform where admins can create isolated community spaces for members to request and offer help. Each community is completely private with its own admin control.

## 🏘️ Platform Overview

**Assistly is a multi-community platform where:**
- Each community is **completely private and isolated**
- Every community has its own **admin** who manages members and activities
- Users can **only see and participate** in their own community
- Admins **approve/reject** all join requests
- No cross-community visibility or data sharing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key (optional, for AI chatbot)
```

### 3. Deploy Firestore Security Rules
```bash

```

```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3001`
